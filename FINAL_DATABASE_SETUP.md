# 🎯 Final Database Setup - Complete Solution

## The Problem
You can't find the users table because the database tables haven't been created yet. The `users` table is managed by Supabase Auth automatically, but we need to create the `profiles` table and all other tables.

## The Solution
Run the `complete-database-setup.sql` script to create ALL necessary tables.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps:

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Sign in to your account
- Select your project: `rkwgjrlydhaoqjibrurh`

### 2. Navigate to SQL Editor
- In the left sidebar, click on "SQL Editor"
- Click "New query"

### 3. Copy and Paste the Complete Setup Script
- Open the file `complete-database-setup.sql` in your project
- Copy ALL the contents (it's about 600+ lines)
- Paste it into the SQL Editor

### 4. Run the Script
- Click the "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
- Wait for it to complete (should take 10-15 seconds)

## 📊 What This Script Creates:

### **Tables Created:**
✅ `profiles` - User profiles (this is what you were looking for!)  
✅ `products` - Cybersecurity products for your shop  
✅ `orders` - Order management  
✅ `order_items` - Individual items in orders  
✅ `cart_items` - Shopping cart  
✅ `wishlist_items` - User wishlists  
✅ `user_roles` - User role management  
✅ `internships` - Internship positions  
✅ `internship_applications` - Internship applications  

### **Enums Created:**
✅ `user_role` - admin, user  
✅ `app_role` - admin, moderator, user  
✅ `product_status` - active, inactive, out_of_stock  
✅ `order_status` - pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled  
✅ `internship_status` - open, closed, in_progress, completed  

### **Security & Functions:**
✅ **RLS Policies** - Proper access control for all tables  
✅ **Database Functions** - Order number generation, role management  
✅ **Triggers** - Automatic timestamp updates  
✅ **Indexes** - Performance optimization  

### **Sample Data:**
✅ **3 Cybersecurity Products** (ESP32 tools, USB Rubber Ducky, RFID kits)  
✅ **2 Sample Internships** (Cybersecurity, ESP32 development)  

## 🔍 After Running the Script:

### **You'll be able to:**
- ✅ **View users** in the `profiles` table
- ✅ **Add/edit products** in the admin panel
- ✅ **Manage internships** in the admin panel
- ✅ **Handle orders** and shopping cart
- ✅ **Manage user roles** and permissions
- ✅ **Process internship applications**

### **Database Structure:**
```
auth.users (managed by Supabase Auth)
    ↓
public.profiles (user profiles with roles)
    ↓
public.user_roles (role management)
    ↓
public.products (shop items)
public.orders (order management)
public.internships (internship positions)
```

## 🎉 Verification:

After running the script, you should see:
- ✅ All tables created successfully
- ✅ Sample data inserted
- ✅ RLS policies working
- ✅ No more "table not found" errors

## 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **The `users` table** is managed by Supabase Auth automatically
2. **The `profiles` table** is what you'll use for user management
3. **User roles** are stored in the `user_roles` table
4. **All tables** have proper RLS policies for security

## 🔧 If You Need Admin Access:

After running the script, you can make yourself an admin by running this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace 'your-email@example.com' with your actual email
SELECT public.assign_admin_by_email('your-email@example.com');
```
